# TMUX Setup
A very basic guide to install and use TMUX.

1. Install TMUX. Run the following:
```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

2. Start up TMUX. Run the following:
```bash
tmux
```

3. Split the window. Type: `Ctrl + b, %`
That mean `Ctrl` and `b` at the same time, then you can let go and type `shift` and `5` aka `%`

4. To switch between windows. Type: `Ctrl + b, LEFT_ARROW` or `Ctrl + b, RIGHT_ARROW`

5. To stop tmux. Run `exit` to close each window. Or `Ctrl + b, d`
